# Lesson 3: Linear Combination

## 1. Linear Combination Part 1
- basis vectors: two vectors i-hat, j-hat
- x, y coords are 1,0 or 0,1 defining the space
- vectors are sum of these
- set of all vectors
- "linear combination"
- you can make a plane by scaling and adding two vectors
    - basis vectors on same line is linear combination line

## 2. Linear Combination Part 2
- span 3D vectors adding third vector not on span of first two
- linearly dependent: vectors overlap

## 3. Linear Combination and Span
- multiply vectors by scalars and add them
- span then is the set of all

## 4. Quiz
- check for understanding linear combination

## 5. Linear Dependency
- determine linear dependency

## 6. Solving a Simplified Set of Equations
- figure out scalar from linear combination
- solve graphically, with substitution or elimination

## 7. Quiz
- check you understood linear dependency

## 8. Quiz
- check you understood linear combinations
