# Lesson 4: Control Flow

## 1. Introduction
- different types of control flow and how we'll use them

## 2. Conditional Statements
- structuring `if` statements
- structuring `if ... elif ... else` statements
- indentation and using four spaces, not tabs
- Python3 does not allow mixing tabs and spaces

## 3-4 Practice: Conditional Statements
- write a very basic if statement

## 5-6 Conditional Statements
- practice writing conditionals for `if...elif` statements

## 7. Boolean Expressions for Conditions
- not just checking greater, less, equals
- do math or use logical operators
- everything must evaluate to a `bool`
- truthy and falsy values

## 8-9 Quiz & Solution
- understand how complex boolean statements evaluate
- use previous answer that already formatted response from branching assignment to `prize`

## 10. For loops
- iteration with `for` loops, `in`, and named iterator variables
- `range` function to create a collection of numbers, inclusive of lower but exclusive of upper bounds
- using `range(len(my_list))` to keep reference to index of element while iterating through

## 11-12 Practice
- use `for` and `range` to iterate through list of strings and ints

## 13-14 Quiz
- modify strings a list of strings
- understand that changing value of iterating variable does not modify original list
- modify list with element vs index iteration
- add to and format list into html list

## 15. Quiz: Match Inputs to Outputs
- predict output of different range calls, including going from 0 to a negative number
- answer the missing line in a for loop

## 16. Building Dictionaries
- using a list of keys to build a dict including checking whether key exists before assigning a value
- use `get()` to assign if exists or assign default

## 17. Iterating through Dictionaries with For Loops
- iterate through keys with same syntax as with lists
- iterate through both keys and values with `.items()`

## 18-19 Quiz & Solution
- use dictionaries to count fruits among items in baskets

## 20. While Loops
- run some statements until conditional evaluates to `True`
- `sum` to add all elements in list and `pop` to return the last one

## 21-22 Practice
- factorial with `while` then refactor into `for`

## 23-24 Quiz
- use `while` to make a range and also to find nearest squares

## 25. For Loops vs. While Loops
- use `for` when iteration times or collection is known
- use `while` until a condition is met

## 26-27 Quiz & Solution
- `while` should have a conditional and alter the compared variable in that conditional in the body
- decide to use `for` or `while` to iterate through and conditionally sum a list of numbers

## 28. Break, Continue
- `continue` and `break` to finish loop iteration or entire loop early
- see it working in a solution to the "cargo loading problem"

## 29-30 Quiz & Solution
- use `break` to build up and print out a string of an exact length

## 31-32 Practice & Solution
- use a `for` loop to check for primes and nonprimes in a list

## 33. Zip and Enumerate
- `zip` same-length lists into a list of tuples of same-index elements of each list
- `enumerate` to get explicit `index, value` pairs for each element in a collection

## 34-35 Quiz & Solution
- use `zip` to format a coordinates string from multiple lists, build a dictionary
- use `dict(zip())` to build kv pairs using two separate lists
- unzip by zipping the unpacked zipped list and assigning each tuple to a variable
- use `zip` to transpose a 4x3 matrix to a 3x4 matrix
- use `enumerate` to modify one list with values from another

## 36. List Comprehensions
- make lists using loop inside of brackets
- use conditions inside the comprehension

## 37-38 Quiz & Solution
- use list comprehension to work with strings, integers and a dictionary

## 39-40 Practice & Solution
- loop through dictionaries and build lists to count names across lists

# 41. Conclusion
- good job, next time functions!
