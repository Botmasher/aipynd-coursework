# Lesson 1: Introduction

## 1. Our Goal
- cover some tools for training neural networks
- not a complete introduction to linear algebra

## 2. Instructors
- the guy from the YT channel plus 2 phd instructors

## 3. Essence of Linear Algebra
- using "visual intuitions" to get a sense of calculations over complex formulas
- "geometric understanding" over the numerical stuff that computers can handle

## 4. Structure of this lesson
- videos, theory, labs
- final lesson putting everything together for neural network

## 5. Working with Equations
- intro to using their tool
- write in LaTeX

## 6-7. Practice
- use workspace and try out LaTeX
