# Lesson 4: Linear Transformation and Matrices

(References to sections at end of key points)
- m by n matrix
- add matrices with same dimensions (2)
    - just add elements in same spots
- scalar multiplication multiplying each element (4)
- square matrix multiplication is easiest (5)
    - multiply two matrices `p * q`
    - multiply across columns adding results together
- general matrix multiplication (7)
    - not same dimensions but number of rows in first must match columns in second
    - do the same row-column multiply-add
    - it's not commutative so `p * q` is not `q * p`!
- linear transformation (9-11)
    - how to think of a matrix while moving it in space
    - origin remains fixed, lines remain lines (no curves)
    - represent transformations of i-hat and j-hat
    - then solve to find where initial matrix lands
