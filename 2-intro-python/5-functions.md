# Lesson 5: Functions

## 1. Introduction
- we'll cover defining and using functions, lambdas and more

## 2. Defining Functions
- syntax for defining and calling a function
- understand dealing with local values vs returning values
- setting default arguments
    - me: but careful with default collections and ref vals

## 3-4 Quiz & Solution
- answer a question about defining then define a simple function

## 5. Check for Understanding
- review what kinds of statements different statements are
- terminology (function, argument, method, call)

## 6. Variable Scope
- rules for when you have access to a variable (local or global)
- local variables inside functions
- can read global vars in local scope but not modify them
- best practice: define variables in smallest scope needed

## 7-8 Quiz & Solution
- one question working with scope

## 9. Check for Understanding
- local scope variable name takes precedence over same-name global scope
- assigning and accessing variables inside and outside local scope

## 10. Documentation
- use docstrings surrounded by triple quotes to document functions
- understand good practice including summary, args, types and explanations

## 11-12 Quiz & Solution
- practice writing a docstring

## 13. Lambda Expressions
- defining lambda with one or more args and an expression
- can store lambda in a variable and run from variable

## 14-15 Quiz & Solution
- use lambdas concisely to rewrite `map` and `filter` calls

## 16. Iterators and Generators
- lazy way to build iterables
- especially when can't fit in memory
- use loop to iterate through or build list from it
- working with infinite series

## 17-18 Quiz & Solution
- implement indexer and chunker using generator

## 19. Generator Expressions
- build a list using list comprehension and range

## 20. Conclusion
- you learned a bunch about functions, now piece them together into a script
