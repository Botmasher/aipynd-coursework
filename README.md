# Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Coursework

A place to store my notes, example code, exercises and other work during my time enrolled in Udacity's AI Python Nanodegree program. Section/final projects will be stored in their own repos.

My cohort starts 5 February 2019.

## Course Organization
The course team has split the courseload into `parts`, with each `part` having one or more `lessons`, and each `lesson` in `lessons` having one or more `concepts`. I am attempting to mirror that breakdown in my notes.

The `parts` seem to be overarching courses or trajectories. The `lessons` inside them teach many `concepts` around a single topic. A `concept` is like a single page with explanatory text, embedded videos (usually) and exercises (sometimes).
