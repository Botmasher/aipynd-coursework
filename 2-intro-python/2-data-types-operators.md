# Lesson 2: Data Types and Operators

## 1. Introduction
- these are the building blocks for other programming skills
- two boxes for input (edit code) and output (view results)

## 2. Arithmetic Operators
- typical mathematic symbols for operators
- typical order of operations
- `%` for modulo, `**` for exponentiation, `Ë†` for bitwise XOR
- `//` to round down integer in division (even if answer is negative)

## 3-4 Quiz & Solution
- testing your basic skills with arithmetic operators
- they prefer spaces around plus and minus operators but not multiplication and division
- they prefer no space after function name in function call

## 5. Variables and Assignment Operators
- assignment operator equals sign, variable name on its left, value on its right
- assign multiple variables on one line separated by commas
- give names that are descriptive of their values
- only use letters, numbers, underscores
- do not use reserved words
- snake case your names
- assign with `=`, `+=`, `-=`

## 6-7 Quiz & Solution
- practice assigning and augmenting; I used much `*=`

## 8. Integers and Floats
- two different types based on presence of decimal point
- check types with `type()`
- operation with one or more floats produces a float
- no rounding on type conversion, just add or take off after decimal
- consider when to use each based on whether you need a whole number
- floats are approximations
  - `0.1` is slightly higher than 0.1
  - so `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 != 0.3`
- whitespace practices
  - no space between function name and opening parens
  - spaces around operators
  - 79-99 character lines instead of longer lines
  - multiple lines are ok!
- see PEP 8 for more standards

## 9. Quiz
- a few real-life examples of floats vs ints
- try dividing by zero

## 10. Booleans
- values `True` or `False`
- comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- logical operators `and`, `or`, `not`

## 11-12 Quiz & Solution
- do a boolean comparison
- understand the difference between `=` and `==`

## 13. Strings
